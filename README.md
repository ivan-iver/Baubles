# My configuration files

***

This repository contains my own configuration files.

There are a lot of dotfiles, a lot of castles, a little mess… Why don’t we create a one single castle with all of our dotfiles? For some people it can be a reasonable option, but, in general, having them organized has some advantages:

* You can keep different configurations for the same application. A ssh at home and another at work.

* You can keep public the dotfiles you would like to share with the community (vim) and private the ones you don’t want to (mutt).
